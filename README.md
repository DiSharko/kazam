CS32 Term Project - Kazam

Kazam is a final group project for CS32 - Software Engineering - during spring 2013 at Brown University.

Kazam, inspired by the spell and battle mechanics of Magicka and League of Legends, is a 2D top-down networked game where up to 4 players choose spells and can play either a deathmatch map or team capture-the-flag.

The project was compiled using Eclipse.
