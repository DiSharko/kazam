CS32 Term Project - Shazam

This was our group final project for the class CS32 - Software Engineering - at Brown University.

Shazam, inspired by the spell and battle mechanics of Magicka and League of Legends, is a 2D top-down networked game where up to 4 players can choose spells and fight on maps for deathmatch mode or capture the flag.

The project was compiled using Eclipse.
